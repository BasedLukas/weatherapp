Welcome to my weather app.
I built this to get familiar with using API's, Json and Tkinter. 
In order to run,make sure you have all dependencies installed. 
I think the only one that isn't built in to python is Pillow

Run the main.py file to get the main menu.
You can then choose to use the CLI or GUI.
CLI won't work until you create the citylist.json file. See below


to find out more about the API visit https://openweathermap.org/
In the config file you will find an API key. If the api stops working you can get a new key and paste it in there.
You can also edit the city_names list. This is the list of cities available in the GUI.
First search for the city in the CLI to make sure it exists, then add it to the list.

The functions.py page contains basic program functions. Some of the functions are used by both the CLI and GUI
Others are exclusive to one or the other. Check the comments by each function

gui.py contains everything needed to run the gui. It makes use of some functions.py functions

test.py is for testing new code, none of the code there should run in the final app

You need to create a json file called citylist.json The reason for this is that it is too large for github, so I cannot upload it myself
Download and unpack this file: https://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/city.list.json.gz
make sure it is in the same directory and that it's called citylist.json
citylist.json contains a list of all possible cities you can request weather from.

icon.png is the image displayed by each weather report in the gui.It is re-downloaded for every new report.
app_icon.ico is used in the gui window at the top left
